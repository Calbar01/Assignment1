       <!--I have used p tags similary here to give a brief intro to who i am-->
       <h2>A bit about me...</h2>
       <p>I have studied web design since i started sixth form in 2017, when i undertook a CTEC in ICT, acheiving a distinction in it. I have good understanding of both HTML and CSS, and little knowledge in Javascript, Java and some in Python as well.
           <br> I currently study Business Computing with web design, in my first year at the University of Northampton, and i'm loving every second of it!
        <br>I aspire to enter the industry to gain a more in depth knowledge of web development, as well as to hone my own skills.
